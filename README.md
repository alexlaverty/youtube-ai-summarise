# YouTube Subtitle AI Summarise

This repository provides a Python script to extract subtitles from a YouTube video and summarize the main key points using a local AI model powered by Ollama. It's a simple and efficient way to quickly understand the content of a video without watching it in full.

## How to Run

1. [Install Ollama, download a model and serve it.](https://ollama.com/)

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script with the following command:

```
python app.py --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"
```

## How It Works

The script takes a YouTube video URL as input and uses the pytube library to extract English subtitles from the video. These subtitles are then sent to a locally running instance of Ollama, which uses an AI model (e.g., Llama 2) to generate a concise summary of the video's key points. The summary is displayed in the terminal for easy reading.

## Example Output

```
python app.py --url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIp_jwHMjIk

--- Key Points from the Video ---
1. The core message is that nuclear fusion could revolutionize space travel and exploration by providing a propulsion system that can get us to Mars or other distant planets quickly, without the need for chemical rockets or long travel times.
2. Pulsar Fusion has announced the design of their Sunbird project, which uses dutyium helium fusion for power generation. The thrust generated by this fuel could save time in space missions and help them get to Mars earlier than estimated.
3. Nuclear thermal propulsion, which involves using a nuclear reactor to heat up a propellant like hydrogen until it gets super hot expands and shoots out at the back to create thrust, has been tinkered with by NASA since the 1960s but is currently in a state of hiatus.
4. Nuclear electric propulsion, which uses nuclear fishision to generate electricity and then accelerates charged particles and thrust from them, is highly efficient but the thrust is small and can't get us to Mars quickly.
5. Elon Musk hopes to bring people to Mars by 2026 using nuclear fusion-powered thrusters.
6. Brilliant offers courses on various topics in science, computer science, and mathematics, including quantum mechanics. It provides interactive visualizations and follow-up questions for each course.
7. Visit brilliant.org/sabena or scan the QR code to try out everything that Brilliant has to offer for a full 30 days with 20% off the annual premium subscription.
8. The subtitle also mentions that other people are interested in nuclear fusion as space propulsion technology, but it doesn't mention SpaceX, which is not using nuclear fusion.
9. It suggests that learning more about the science behind various topics can help improve understanding and confidence in exploring space.
10. Finally, it highlights Brilliant's educational resources, such as courses on quantum mechanics, that may be beneficial for further exploration of this topic.
